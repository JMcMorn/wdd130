    <h1>Lindisfarne - England.</h1>
    <p>Back when I was a lad we lived perhaps 15 minutes from here. I suppose "City" is a bit of a stretch, it's a
        ruined monastary on a small island, home to mostly puffins and seagulls. It's still one of my favourite places
        with a rich history. It's where the vikings first landed when they invaded England. One of the kinds of Engalnd
        attempted to flea there and was swallowd by the tides. A rather unique aspect to it is that the island is only
        accessible at low tide. There are signs all along the road warning that if the tide is about to turn to stay
        away. There's very tall towers so the foolish needn't perish but there are many vantage points from the isle to
        watch car's get washed away. There's always at least one. </p>
    <p2> I suppose it's my favourite aside from all the cool history is because it's home to many of my strongest
        memories from my youth there. Swimming in the
        North Sea (ill advised), lobster picking, watching the turning of the tides and eating soft serve in the pouring
        rain were all unforgettable.
